# OS Scheduling Algorithms Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of various Operating System scheduling algorithms. It is designed to provide a clear understanding of how different scheduling techniques work and their impact on process execution. The project includes the following algorithms:

- **FIFO (First In First Out) Scheduling**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling**
- **HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next) Scheduling**
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) Scheduling**
- **Round-Robin Scheduling**

## Features

- Interactive user input for process details (arrival time, burst time, etc.).
- Calculation and display of key metrics such as turnaround time and waiting time for each scheduling algorithm.
- Clear and concise visual representation of process execution order (e.g., Gantt charts).
- Modular and reusable code structure for each scheduling algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA
- Version Control: Git
